# Python Platformer Game

This project is a simple 2D single-screen platformer game developed in Python, using the PyGame module. 

In it, players need to overcome various challenges to progress through different levels, each with increasing difficulty, while navigating through various terrains filled with obstacles and enemies. 

The game features a main menu which provides the player with the options to either start a new game or exit it. After pressing start and begining the game, the player must pass all 7 current levels in order to win. The main objective is to reach the exit door of each level by walking across tiles, jumping across both static and dynamic platforms, and avoiding threats such as enemy creatures and lava. Throughout the game, players need to collect as many coins as possible in order to increase their high score.

Upon coming into contact with a green blob creature, falling into a pit of lava or falling off the screen, the game is over and the player is presented with a screen that showcases their highest score yet, as well as the options to restart the game from the beginning or exit the game.
